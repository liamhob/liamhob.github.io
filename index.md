# Hello World  

This is my home page! My name is **Liam Hobayan** and I am a student at [Cal State Fullerton](http://www.fullerton.edu/). My major is **Computer Engineering**.

### CPSC 120  

- **Lab 6: Command Line Mad Lib**  
  Lab 6 was one of my favorites because it combined creativity with programming.  
  I learned how to use command-line arguments to accept user input and dynamically process it in a structured format.  
  This project showed me how to make interactive and engaging programs that can take user input and produce meaningful results.  

- **Lab 7: Blackjack Hand Calculator**  
  Lab 7, part 2 was a favorite because I was always curious about how the game Blackjack works.  
  I learned how to write functions that correctly calculate the value of a hand, including the complexities of handling multiple Aces.  
  This lab helped me practice using conditionals and loops to implement game logic effectively.  

- **Lab 9: Array Manipulation**  
  In Lab 9, I learned how to use arrays to store and manipulate data efficiently.  
  The lab focused on solving problems such as finding averages and searching for elements within an array.  
  It strengthened my understanding of how data structures can simplify complex operations and how they are used in real-world scenarios.
